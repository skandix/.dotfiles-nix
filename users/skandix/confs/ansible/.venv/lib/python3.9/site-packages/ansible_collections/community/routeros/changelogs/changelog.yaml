      minor_changes:
      - Avoid internal ansible-core module_utils in favor of equivalent public API
        available since at least Ansible 2.9 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/38).
      - api - add options ``validate_certs`` (default value ``true``), ``validate_cert_hostname``

  2.0.0-a1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - 'api - due to a programming error, the module never failed on errors. This
        has now been fixed. If you are relying on the module not failing in case of
        idempotent commands (resulting in errors like ``failure: already have such
        address``), you need to adjust your roles/playbooks. We suggest to use ``failed_when``
        to accept failure in specific circumstances, for example ``failed_when: "''failure:
        already have '' in result.msg[0]"`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/39).'
      release_summary: First prerelease for a new major release with a breaking change
        in the behavior of ``community.routeros.api``.

    - 39-api-fail.yml
    release_date: '2021-07-31'
  2.0.0-a2:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - api - splitting commands no longer uses a naive split by whitespace, but a
        more RouterOS CLI compatible splitting algorithm (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/45).
      - command - the module now always indicates that a change happens. If this is
        not correct, please use ``changed_when`` to determine the correct changed
        status for a task (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/50).
      bugfixes:
      - api - improve splitting of ``WHERE`` queries (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/47).
      - api - when converting result lists to dictionaries, no longer removes second
        ``=`` and text following that if present (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/47).
      - routeros cliconf plugin - adjust function signature that was modified in Ansible
        after creation of this plugin (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/43).
      minor_changes:
      - api - make validation of ``WHERE`` for ``query`` more strict (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/53).
